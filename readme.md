# Beautycounter Technical Screen:
The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate working knowledge of Back-end Development with Javascript (Node.js/ESNext). You can use any framework or boiler plate you are comfortable with. The software engineering team at Beautycounter uses Express, Firestore and Typescript.

## Backend Requirements
Build a RESTful API in Node.js that returns information on various skin care products: Name, Price, Link, Rating, Category. Categories group similar products together.

Create an endpoint that allows an API consumer to:
1. submit a new skin care product
2. retrieve details of one skin care product
3. retrieve skin care products by category and ordered by rating

- The API should handle:
1. being shut down and spun back up without losing data.
2. handle cases where a category does not exist
3. handle the case where an item is submitted with an invalid schema

## Evaluation
This assignment is not timed. You are free to use any framework, boiler plate, or libraries to complete the task. The submission will be evaluated on if it is clean, concise, satisfy the requirements, and runs on a local environment. The submission will not be evaluated on whether or not it is a fully distributed production level application.

## To Submit
Please push your code to a GitHub repository so our team can access and code review OR send us your code in something like a git bundle file `https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle`. Ensure your API can be run on localhost without errors.
